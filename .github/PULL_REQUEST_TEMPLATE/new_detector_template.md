#### New Detector Checklist

- [ ] My new detector implements `IDefaultOffComponentDetector`
- [ ] I have created a PR to the [verification repo](https://github.com/microsoft/componentdetection-verification) with components that my new detector can find
- [ ] (If necessary) I have updated the [Feature Overview](https://github.com/microsoft/component-detection/blob/main/README.md#feature-overview) table in the README
