# Maven Detection

## Requirements

Maven detection depends on the following to successfully run:

- Maven CLI as part of your PATH. mvn should be runnable from a given command line.
- Maven Dependency Plugin (installed with Maven).
- One or more `pom.xml` files.

## Detection strategy

Maven detection is performed by running `mvn dependency:tree -f {pom.xml}` for each pom file and parsing down the results.

Components tagged as a test dependency are marked as development dependencies.

Full dependency graph generation is supported.

## Known limitations

Maven detection will not run if `mvn` is unavailable.
