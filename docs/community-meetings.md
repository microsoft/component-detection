# Community meetings

Component Detection community meetings happen every four weeks on Wednesdays at 9:00 AM Pacific Time. The meeting is open to everyone and is a great way to get involved with the project. We have [an overarching issue][1] listing the upcoming meeting, as well as all previous meetings.

## Running the meeting

Our community meetings are run by members of our team. Here's a checklist of things to do before, during and after the meeting.

### Before the meeting

1. Open the discussion for the meeting (You should be able to find it in the [overarching issue][1])
1. Open the issues and pull requests search since the last meeting (It should be linked in the discussion)

### During the meeting

1. Record the meeting
1. Discuss the issues and pull requests that have been opened since the last meeting
    - Highlight any issues or pull requests that need attention
1. Discuss any other topics that have been added to the agenda

### After the meeting

1. Update:
    - The agenda with any notes from the meeting
    - The attendees list
    - Upload the recording
1. Create a new discussion for the next meeting. Use the following template, and update the dates for: "Find in your timezone", "Issues opened since last meeting" and "PRs opened since last meeting"
