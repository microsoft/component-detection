            👋 Hi! It looks like you modified some files in the `Detectors` folder.
            You may need to bump the detector versions if any of the following scenarios apply:
            * The detector detects more or fewer components than before
            * The detector generates different parent/child graph relationships than before
            * The detector generates different `devDependencies` values than before

            If none of the above scenarios apply, feel free to ignore this comment 🙂
