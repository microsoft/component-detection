Parsing of RFC strings is supported as well.\n* Generic parsing of dates in almost any string format;\n* Timezone (tzinfo) implementations for tzfile(5) format\n  files (/etc/localtime, /usr/share/zoneinfo, etc), TZ\n  environment string (in all known formats), iCalendar\n  format files, given ranges (with help from relative deltas),\n  local machine timezone, fixed offset timezone, UTC timezone,\n  and Windows registry-based time zones.\n* Internal up-to-date world timezone information based on\n  Olson's database.\n* Computing of Easter Sunday dates for any given year,\n  using Western, Orthodox or Julian algorithms;\n* A comprehensive test suite.\n\nQuick example\n=============\nHere's a snapshot, just to give an idea about the power of the\npackage. For more examples, look at the documentation.\n\nSuppose you want to know how much time is left, in\nyears/months/days/etc, before the next easter happening on a\nyear with a Friday 13th in August, and you want to get today's\ndate out of the \"date\" unix system command. Here is the code:\n\n.. code-block:: python3\n\n    >>> from dateutil.relativedelta import *\n    >>> from dateutil.easter import *\n    >>> from dateutil.rrule import *\n    >>> from dateutil.parser import *\n    >>> from datetime import *\n    >>> now = parse(\"Sat Oct 11 17:13:46 UTC 2003\")\n    >>> today = now.date()\n    >>> year = rrule(YEARLY,dtstart=now,bymonth=8,bymonthday=13,byweekday=FR)[0].year\n    >>> rdelta = relativedelta(easter(year), today)\n    >>> print(\"Today is: %s\" % today)\n    Today is: 2003-10-11\n    >>> print(\"Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: %s\" % year)\n    Year with next Aug 13th on a Friday is: 2004\n    >>> print(\"How far is the Easter of that year: %s\" % rdelta)\n    How far is the Easter of that year: relativedelta(months=+6)\n    >>> print(\"And the Easter of that year is: %s\" % (today+rdelta))\n    And the Easter of that year is: 2004-04-11\n\nBeing exactly 6 months ahead was **really** a coincidence :)\n\nContributing\n============\n\nWe welcome many types of contributions - bug reports, pull requests (code, infrastructure or documentation fixes).
