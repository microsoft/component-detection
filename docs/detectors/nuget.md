# NuGet Detection

## Requirements

NuGet Detection depends on the following to successfully run: 

- One or more `*.nuspec`, `*.nupkg`, `*.packages.config`, or `.*csproj` files.
- The files each NuGet detector searches for:  
    - [The `NuGet` detector looks for `*.nupkg`, `*.nuspec`, `nuget.config`, `paket.lock`][1]
    - [The `NuGetPackagesConfig` detector looks for `packages.config`][2]
    - [The `NuGetProjectCentric` detector looks for `project.assets.json`][3]

## Detection Strategy 

NuGet Detection is performed by parsing any `*.nuspec`, `*.nupkg`, `*.packages.config`, or `*.project.assets` files found under the scan directory. By searching for all `*.nuspec,` `*.nupkg` files on disk the global NuGet cache gets searched which can include packages that are not included in the final build.

## Known Limitations

- The NuGet detector is currently overreporting because the global NuGet cache gets searched. This is because of NuGet's [restore behaviour][4] which downloads all possible dependencies before [resolving the final dependency graph][5]. To solve this overreporting a new NuGet Detector approach will be rolled out. This new approach will now only parse `*.packages.config` and `*.project.assets` (`*.csproj`) files. This means any components that are only found in `*.nuspec` or `*.nupkg` files will not be detected with the new NuGet Detector approach.
- There are also dependencies from the .NET SDK that are underreported. The list of dependencies can be found [here][6].
